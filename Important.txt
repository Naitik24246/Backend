We have started Backend series from chai aur code channel 
here are the important definations and important questions for revising and explanations
Firstly we have File structure in which there are many differnet types of file to have clean coding environment and make code to look good.

we have One Public file:
Serves static assets to the frontend (only used if the backend also serves frontend files).

Then we have one src file in which all the backend codebase lives here.
In src there are many other components:- 

1. Routes: Defines all the API endpoints and organizes them based on feature/domain
2. Controllers:Handles the main business logic for each route.
3. models:Defines database schemas using Mongoose (MongoDB) or any ORM/ODM.
4. middlewares:Contains reusable functions to process requests before controllers handle them.
5. db : Contains reusable functions to process requests before controllers handle them.
6. Helper or utilis: Utility functions used across the app (email, date formatter, token generation).
7. app.js: Set up middlewares, parsers, routes â€“ core Express configuration.
8. index.js: The entry point of your backend server. Starts the app.
9. constants.js:Central place to store constants like messages, regex, app-specific enums.
10. .env : Contains secret information about your app your api key and many more
